            "Abstract: Current research on trend detection in artificial intelligence (AI) mainly concerns academic data sources and industrial applications of AI. However, we argue that industrial trends are influenced by public perception and political decisions (e.g., through industry subsidies and grants) and should be reflected in political data sources. To investigate this hypothesis, we examine the AI trend development in German business and politics from 1998 to 2020. Therefore, we propose a web mining approach to collect a novel data set consisting of business and political data sources combining 1.07 million articles and documents. We identify 246 AI-related buzzwords extracted from various glossaries. We use them to conduct an extensive trend detection and analysis study on the collected data using machine learning-based approaches. This study successfully detects an AI trend and follows its evolution in business and political data sources over the past two decades. Moreover, we find a faster adoption of AI in business than in politics, with a considerable increase in policy discourse in recent years. Finally, we show that the collected data can be used for trend detection besides AI-related topics using topic clustering and the COVID-19 pandemic as examples.\n",

            "Abstract: In the last decades, crypto assets have become particularly popular in financial markets. However, public awareness of the crypto asset landscape is rather limited, and usually associated with sensationalized media coverage of a handful of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, while users of crypto assets primarily collect information on Internet, there is a limited understanding of the relational (online) structures supporting the diffusion of information about these financial products. Therefore, the aim of this study is to uncover the structure of online information referral networks dedicated to crypto assets. By adopting a multi-method approach consisting of web scraping, web analytics, and social network analysis, we use data from the top 200 crypto assets by market capitalization to identify pivotal websites and the overall connectedness of the information referral networks. Our results show that social media and news channel sites play a key role in the information diffusion process, while market and trading sites signal innovation adoption. Overall, cryptocurrencies’ websites do not seem key in the referral network, as opposed to social media websites which, however, cannot be considered mature hubs because of their low connectivity.\n",

            "Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing prevalence of mining web pages using the new web technology of WebAssembly (WASM), resulting in the unauthorized exploitation of user resources. However, existing detection methods have shown limited ability to counter obfuscation techniques and have exhibited low detection efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel static detection method based on the visualization of WASM modules. The proposed method involves instantiating the binary files of the WASM mining operations within web pages. These binary files are then combined with the information of local entropy and global entropy, resulting in the visualization of RGB images. Compared to grayscale images, RGB images retain more of the original file information. After training and learning the image features using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.18% when tested on real-world web pages. This accuracy is approximately 2% higher than that of existing visualization-based detection methods. Moreover, the model exhibits a shorter execution time. The proposed NoCrypto method demonstrates quick execution speed and accurate detection.\n",

            "Abstract: The 2008–2009 financial crisis exposed significant flaws in the Basel II regulatory framework, which was designed to ensure the stability of banking institutions during crises. This economic turmoil led to a loss of confidence in financial systems, liquidity shortages, and a deepening debt crisis across Europe. In response, regulatory standards were reformed, resulting in the development of the Basel III framework, which built upon three pillars. Pillar 1 introduced better capital forms, higher capital ratios, and capital reserves. Pillar 2 increased risk management requirements and emphasized the supervisory authorities’ responsibilities. Pillar 3 enhanced the scope and detail of published information, aiming to improve market discipline and stakeholder understanding of banks’ risks and capital positions. Our study analyzes how crisis periods affected interest in Pillar 3 disclosures, examining changes in interest from 2016 to 2022 using data from a specific bank’s log files. The results, performed through association analysis, indicate a significant decrease in interest in mandatory disclosures during the periods of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine.\n",

            "Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive review of the challenges associated with using massive web-mined corpora for the pre-training of large language models (LLMs). This review identifies key challenges in this domain, including challenges such as noise (irrelevant or misleading information), duplication of content, the presence of low-quality or incorrect information, biases, and the inclusion of sensitive or personal information in web-mined corpora. Addressing these issues is crucial for the development of accurate, reliable, and ethically responsible language models. Through an examination of current methodologies for data cleaning, pre-processing, bias detection and mitigation, we highlight the gaps in existing approaches and suggest directions for future research. Our discussion aims to catalyze advancements in developing more sophisticated and ethically responsible LLMs.\n",

            "Abstract: Traditional data sources provide insufficient knowledge for measuring the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Data related to SDGs are sourced primarily from global databases maintained by international organizations, national statistical offices and other government agencies. Recent studies show the value of using data from Citizen Science (CS) for assessing the SDGs. There is an important online presence of CS programs, professional networks for CS and online communities of citizen scientists, leading to the generation of several CS platforms. In this context, the role of computational data science is key. This paper explores and exemplifies opportunities for combining web-data mining techniques and automatic classifiers to enhance the understanding of the inter-relation between CS and the SDGs. An analysis of different automatic classifiers is presented by comparing the results obtained from their application in a sample of 208 CS project descriptions. The results of this study indicate the benefits and limitations of these techniques (nCoder, ESA, OSDG and BERT), but also provides a discussion of the potential benefits of using data from CS projects to map the 17 SDGs.\n",

            "Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to faster digitalization and illegal online gambling has become popular. As illegal online gambling brings not only financial threats but also breaches in overall cyber security, this study defines the concept of absolute illegal online gambling (AIOG) using a machine-learning-driven approach with information gathered from public webpages. By analysing 11,172 sites to detect illegal online gambling, the proposed model classifies key features such as URLs (Uniform Resource Locator), WHOIS, INDEX, and landing page information. With a combination of text and image analyses with machine learning-driven approach, the proposed model offers the ensemble combination of attributes for high detection performance with the verification of common attributes from metadata in online gambling. This study suggests a strategy for dynamic resource utilization to increase the classification accuracy of the current environment. As a result, this research expands the scope of hybrid web mining through constant updating of data to achieve content-based filtering.\n",

            "Abstract: Measuring innovation accurately and efficiently is crucial for policymakers to encourage innovation activity. However, the established indicator landscape lacks timeliness and accuracy. In this study, we focus on the country of Mauritius that is transforming its economy towards the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. We seek to extend the knowledge base on innovation activity and the status quo of innovation in Mauritius by applying an unsupervised machine learning approach. Building on previous work on new experimental innovation indicators, we combine recent advances in web mining and topic modeling and address the following research questions: What are potential areas of innovation activity in the ICT sector of Mauritius? Furthermore, do web mining and topic modeling provide sufficient indicators to understand innovation activities in emerging countries? To answer these questions, we apply the natural language processing (NLP) technique of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to ICT companies’ website text data. We then generate topic models from the scraped text data. As a result, we derive seven categories that describe the innovation activities of ICT firms in Mauritius. Albeit the model approach fulfills the requirements for innovation indicators as suggested in the Oslo Manual, it needs to be combined with additional metrics for innovation, for example, with traditional indicators such as patents, to unfold its potential. Furthermore, our approach carries methodological implications and is intended to be reproduced in similar contexts of scarce or unavailable data or where traditional metrics have demonstrated insufficient explanatory power.\n",

            "Abstract: Web usage mining is the process of extracting useful information from web server logs, user interactions, and other web data in order to understand and optimize how users interact with a website. This technique involves analyzing data generated by user activities to discover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform various business and technical decisions. In this research article, we use the Hadoop technique to analyze the behavior of user navigation patterns from log data. This method helps to understand how users interact with websites. For instance, we track the quantity of user logins, the quantity of item sets, the frequency of item sets’ searches, and determine the execution time of various web usage mining algorithms across varying support counts. This article proposes a joint SPM-a priori web mining technique that uses semantic information to improve the generation of frequent sequences and reduces execution time for different support counts. We com-pared existing a priori, web log search, and modified web log search with the proposed join SPM a priori algorithm in Sci-Hub, Pubg game log, Amazon e-commerce, and cryptocurrency datasets. We also found out how long each one took to run for different support counts. The results section says that the proposed SPM-a priori algorithm runs faster than all other algorithms. This means that the proposed system is better for analyzing execution time for user navigational pattern analysis.\n",

            "Abstract: The significance of the web and the crucial role of web archives in its preservation highlight the necessity of understanding how users, both human and robot, access web archive content, and how best to satisfy this disparate needs of both types of users. To identify robots and humans in web archives and analyze their respective access patterns, we used the Internet Archive’s (IA) Wayback Machine access logs from 2012, 2015, and 2019, as well as Arquivo.pt’s (Portuguese Web Archive) access logs from 2019. We identified user sessions in the access logs and classified those sessions as human or robot based on their browsing behavior. To better understand how users navigate through the web archives, we evaluated these sessions to discover user access patterns. Based on the two archives and between the three years of IA access logs (2012 vs. 2015 vs. 2019), we present a comparison of detected robots vs. humans and their user access patterns and temporal preferences. The total number of robots detected in IA 2012 (91% of requests) and IA 2015 (88% of requests) is greater than in IA 2019 (70% of requests). Robots account for 98% of requests in Arquivo.pt (2019). We found that the robots are almost entirely limited to “Dip” and “Skim” access patterns in IA 2012 and 2015, but exhibit all the patterns and their combinations in IA 2019. Both humans and robots show a preference for web pages archived in the near past.\n",

            "Abstract: Data mining is a vital process for extracting valuable knowledge and intriguing patterns from existing databases, tailored for specific objectives. In the context of web usage mining, the increasing intricacies of web usage necessitate the development of more efficient techniques to predict user behaviour and enhance website performance. Traditional clustering approach ensures that related data points are grouped together while segregating unrelated ones. This study introduces the fuzzy clustering method, which involves categorizing a set of data points into multiple clusters. Fuzzy clustering is employed, allowing data points to possess varying degrees of membership in multiple clusters. Traditional data mining algorithms predominantly rely on binary values to identify transaction relationships. However, real-world applications frequently involve transactions with quantitative values, presenting a substantial challenge in algorithm design. Study presents a pioneering approach that leverages fuzzy clustering algorithms to predict the next website request made by users with a degree of uncertainty and vagueness.

            "Abstract: Data preparation is a vital step in the web usage mining process since it provides structured data for the subsequent stages. Hence, it is necessary to convert raw server logs into user sessions to generate structured data for pattern discovery phase. In recent decade, popular websites’ server log production has risen to many terabytes to petabytes each day. As a result, server logs possess big data issues such as storage and processing. This study focuses on initial phases of web usage mining process such as data cleaning, user identification, and session identification. These phases are classified as data-intensive processes and deemed-computation intensive. In the last decade, MapReduce emerges as one of the best parallel programming frameworks for data-intensive applications. An efficient MapReduce-based data pre-processing algorithm, i.e. IRPDP_HT2, is proposed in this study. Previous parallel data pre-processing algorithms either include partial phases or lack with efficient robot detection approaches. IRPDP_HT2 algorithm uses a variety of efficient heuristics in all three phases of data pre-processing to identify both ethical and unethical robots. The suggested IRPDP_HT2 approach is found to be effective and scalable for larger datasets after various experiments on a cluster of nodes. The effectiveness of suggested heuristics is also examined during session identification phase. Three variants of IRPDP_HT2 such as PDP_HT2, IPDP_HT2, and RPDP_HT2 are also developed and tested. Impact of robots’ requests and internal dummy connections’ requests on session count by IRPDP_HT2 algorithm is 45.81% which is more than in PDP_HT2, IPDP_HT2, and RPDP_HT2 algorithms. Further speed-up and size-up are also analysed to demonstrate scalability of algorithm. In the presence of larger datasets, the algorithm’s running time falls, while the number of data nodes grows. The size-up of IRPDP_HT2 demonstrates that even after doubling the input data, the algorithm’s running time does not grow in that ratio for the fixed number of data nodes.\n",

            "Abstract: The size of data on the internet has grown enormously and also growing continuously. Finding any information for a user in response to query has become a challenging task. In this, search engines are playing a vital role. Yet, these are unable to a retrieve the relevant information. These search engines use some limited criteria to fetch the results in response to the user's query after ranking and indexing the pages. In this paper, a multi-criteria-based approach has been proposed to rank web pages. These criteria include keywords, user access count, unique visitors, stay time, hubs, and authority values. The proposed approach uses particle swarm optimization to find the optimal results. And, this algorithm has been compared with some existing algorithms based on iterative improvement and genetic algorithm. It has been observed that the proposed approach is able to find the most relevant top-ranked pages.\n",

            "Abstract: Many companies are redefining their business strategies to improve the business output. Business over internet provides the opportunity to customers and partners where their products and specific business can be found. Web usage mining is the type of web mining activity that involves the automatic discovery of user access patterns from web servers. A real-world challenging task of the web master of an organization is to match the needs of user and keep their attention in their web site. So, web pages can capture the intuition of the user and provide them with the recommendation list. Personalize e-commerce website is done after knowing the habits and behavior patterns of customers e-commerce website using web usage mining with association rules mining apriori algorithms. The method used is a method of analysis and design. In the method of analysis, research variables are determined, and data of sales are collected. In addition, the method of analysis is also performed to measure the accuracy of the apriori algorithm. Designing apriori, program design, and the design of the screen is done in the design method. Results are achieved in the form of an e-commerce website that is personalized using association rules mining apriori algorithm that can recommend the goods in accordance with the preferences and needs of the user. The conclusion of this study is to obtain patterns of association, it takes the data transactions made by customers and the recommendations given by the apriori algorithm would be more accurate if the transaction data is processed more, the categories of goods are fewer, the limit minimum value of support and the limit minimum value of confidence are high.\n",

            "Abstract: Web usage mining is a crucial research area that aims to uncover user behavior patterns from web log data because web usage mining can be used to analyze a website’s usage. This study examined web usage mining to discover online users’ usage patterns and used the results to redesign and improve the government website. This study aims to help online customers obtain a better experience. A dataset was collected from the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) website. Various algorithms, including association rule mining (Apriori and Frequent Pattern-Growth (FP-Growth)) and sequential pattern mining (Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP) and Prefix-Span), were used to mine the user usage data. The first 30 frequently visited patterns of web usage mining results were selected for analysis and to develop a prototype. It revealed that most pages were accessed directly. Moreover, most users were interested in alternative energy information, the Fuel Adjustment Charge (at the given time) or the FT rate, the power outage announcement page, and reducing electric expenses information. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that customers were interested in making online processes, such as using the contact-us feature, downloading forms, and calculating their electric expenses. A survey was conducted with 30 participants and the results were compared with the usage data from the weblog. Welch’s t-test was utilized to evaluate the prototype. The findings indicated that the newly implemented website, based on the user usage patterns, was more effective and reduced the user’s usage time.\n",

            "Abstract: To identify robots and humans and analyze their respective access patterns, we used the Internet Archive’s (IA) Wayback Machine access logs from 2012 and 2019, as well as Arquivo.pt’s (Portuguese Web Archive) access logs from 2019. We identified user sessions in the access logs and classified those sessions as human or robot based on their browsing behavior. To better understand how users navigate through the web archives, we evaluated these sessions to discover user access patterns. Based on the two archives and between the two years of IA access logs (2012 vs. 2019), we present a comparison of detected robots vs. humans and their user access patterns and temporal preferences. The total number of robots detected in IA 2012 is greater than in IA 2019 (21% more in requests and 18% more in sessions). Robots account for 98% of requests (97% of sessions) in Arquivo.pt (2019). We found that the robots are almost entirely limited to “Dip” and “Skim” access patterns in IA 2012, but exhibit all the patterns and their combinations in IA 2019. Both humans and robots show a preference for web pages archived in the near past.\n",

However, we argue that industrial trends are influenced by public perception and political decisions (e.g., through industry subsidies and grants) and should be reflected in political data sources. To investigate this hypothesis, we examine the AI trend development in German business and politics from 1998 to 2020. Therefore, we propose a web mining approach to collect a novel data set consisting of business and political data sources combining 1.07 million articles and documents. We identify 246 AI-related buzzwords extracted from various glossaries. We use them to conduct an extensive trend detection and analysis study on the collected data using machine learning-based approaches. This study successfully detects an AI trend and follows its evolution in business and political data sources over the past two decades. Moreover, we find a faster adoption of AI in business than in politics, with a considerable increase in policy discourse in recent years. Finally, we show that the collected data can be used for trend detection besides AI-related topics using topic clustering and the COVID-19 pandemic as examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

However, public awareness of the crypto asset landscape is rather limited, and usually associated with sensationalized media coverage of a handful of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, while users of crypto assets primarily collect information on Internet, there is a limited understanding of the relational (online) structures supporting the diffusion of information about these financial products. Therefore, the aim of this study is to uncover the structure of online information referral networks dedicated to crypto assets. By adopting a multi-method approach consisting of web scraping, web analytics, and social network analysis, we use data from the top 200 crypto assets by market capitalization to identify pivotal websites and the overall connectedness of the information referral networks. Our results show that social media and news channel sites play a key role in the information diffusion process, while market and trading sites signal innovation adoption. Overall, cryptocurrencies’ websites do not seem key in the referral network, as opposed to social media websites which, however, cannot be considered mature hubs because of their low connectivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

However, existing detection methods have shown limited ability to counter obfuscation techniques and have exhibited low detection efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel static detection method based on the visualization of WASM modules. The proposed method involves instantiating the binary files of the WASM mining operations within web pages. These binary files are then combined with the information of local entropy and global entropy, resulting in the visualization of RGB images. Compared to grayscale images, RGB images retain more of the original file information. After training and learning the image features using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.18% when tested on real-world web pages. This accuracy is approximately 2% higher than that of existing visualization-based detection methods. Moreover, the model exhibits a shorter execution time.

This economic turmoil led to a loss of confidence in financial systems, liquidity shortages, and a deepening debt crisis across Europe. In response, regulatory standards were reformed, resulting in the development of the Basel III framework, which built upon three pillars. Pillar 1 introduced better capital forms, higher capital ratios, and capital reserves. Pillar 2 increased risk management requirements and emphasized the supervisory authorities’ responsibilities. Pillar 3 enhanced the scope and detail of published information, aiming to improve market discipline and stakeholder understanding of banks’ risks and capital positions. Our study analyzes how crisis periods affected interest in Pillar 3 disclosures, examining changes in interest from 2016 to 2022 using data from a specific bank’s log files. The results, performed through association analysis, indicate a significant decrease in interest in mandatory disclosures during the periods of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

Data related to SDGs are sourced primarily from global databases maintained by international organizations, national statistical offices and other government agencies. Recent studies show the value of using data from Citizen Science (CS) for assessing the SDGs. There is an important online presence of CS programs, professional networks for CS and online communities of citizen scientists, leading to the generation of several CS platforms. In this context, the role of computational data science is key. This paper explores and exemplifies opportunities for combining web-data mining techniques and automatic classifiers to enhance the understanding of the inter-relation between CS and the SDGs. An analysis of different automatic classifiers is presented by comparing the results obtained from their application in a sample of 208 CS project descriptions. The results of this study indicate the benefits and limitations of these techniques (nCoder, ESA, OSDG and BERT), but also provides a discussion of the potential benefits of using data from CS projects to map the 17 SDGs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

However, the established indicator landscape lacks timeliness and accuracy. In this study, we focus on the country of Mauritius that is transforming its economy towards the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. We seek to extend the knowledge base on innovation activity and the status quo of innovation in Mauritius by applying an unsupervised machine learning approach. Building on previous work on new experimental innovation indicators, we combine recent advances in web mining and topic modeling and address the following research questions: What are potential areas of innovation activity in the ICT sector of Mauritius? Furthermore, do web mining and topic modeling provide sufficient indicators to understand innovation activities in emerging countries? To answer these questions, we apply the natural language processing (NLP) technique of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to ICT companies’ website text data. We then generate topic models from the scraped text data. As a result, we derive seven categories that describe the innovation activities of ICT firms in Mauritius. Albeit the model approach fulfills the requirements for innovation indicators as suggested in the Oslo Manual, it needs to be combined with additional metrics for innovation, for example, with traditional indicators such as patents, to unfold its potential. Furthermore, our approach carries methodological implications and is intended to be reproduced in similar contexts of scarce or unavailable data or where traditional metrics have demonstrated insufficient explanatory power. |\n",

This work offers a thorough taxonomy of the work being done in this subject, including research projects and the way people use the internet today. During the functioning of the system, extensive information and runtime statistics are recorded in the logs. It includes a log message along with a timestamp that indicates what has taken place in the system. A recent review of the work that has previously performed is also presented, considering various data mining methodologies including clustering and classification. The primary focus of this study is the data preprocessing step, which includes activities such as data cleansing techniques and field extraction at the preliminary stage of ‘web usage mining’. ‘The procedure of ‘extracting’ fields from the log file’s single line is carried out by the field extraction algorithm’. The evaluated data is cleaned by an algorithm that removes items that are incorrect or unnecessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

This technique involves analyzing data generated by user activities to discover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform various business and technical decisions. In this research article, we use the Hadoop technique to analyze the behavior of user navigation patterns from log data. This method helps to understand how users interact with websites. For instance, we track the quantity of user logins, the quantity of item sets, the frequency of item sets’ searches, and determine the execution time of various web usage mining algorithms across varying support counts. This article proposes a joint SPM-a priori web mining technique that uses semantic information to improve the generation of frequent sequences and reduces execution time for different support counts. We com-pared existing a priori, web log search, and modified web log search with the proposed join SPM a priori algorithm in Sci-Hub, Pubg game log, Amazon e-commerce, and cryptocurrency datasets. We also found out how long each one took to run for different support counts. The results section says that the proposed SPM-a priori algorithm runs faster than all other algorithms. This means that the proposed system is better for analyzing execution time for user navigational pattern analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

To identify robots and humans in web archives and analyze their respective access patterns, we used the Internet Archive’s (IA) Wayback Machine access logs from 2012, 2015, and 2019, as well as Arquivo.pt’s (Portuguese Web Archive) access logs from 2019. We identified user sessions in the access logs and classified those sessions as human or robot based on their browsing behavior. To better understand how users navigate through the web archives, we evaluated these sessions to discover user access patterns. Based on the two archives and between the three years of IA access logs (2012 vs. 2015 vs. 2019), we present a comparison of detected robots vs. humans and their user access patterns and temporal preferences. The total number of robots detected in IA 2012 (91% of requests) and IA 2015 (88% of requests) is greater than in IA 2019 (70% of requests). Robots account for 98% of requests in Arquivo.pt (2019). We found that the robots are almost entirely limited to “Dip” and “Skim” access patterns in IA 2012 and 2015, but exhibit all the patterns and their combinations in IA 2019.

In the context of web usage mining, the increasing intricacies of web usage necessitate the development of more efficient techniques to predict user behaviour and enhance website performance. Traditional clustering approach ensures that related data points are grouped together while segregating unrelated ones. This study introduces the fuzzy clustering method, which involves categorizing a set of data points into multiple clusters. Fuzzy clustering is employed, allowing data points to possess varying degrees of membership in multiple clusters. Traditional data mining algorithms predominantly rely on binary values to identify transaction relationships. However, real-world applications frequently involve transactions with quantitative values, presenting a substantial challenge in algorithm design. Study presents a pioneering approach that leverages fuzzy clustering algorithms to predict the next website request made by users with a degree of uncertainty and vagueness. This integration of fuzziness results in more precise predictions of user behaviour. Methodologically, study enhances the conventional clustering and association rule mining method by incorporating fuzzy clustering base fuzzy association rule mining method.

Hence, it is necessary to convert raw server logs into user sessions to generate structured data for pattern discovery phase. In recent decade, popular websites’ server log production has risen to many terabytes to petabytes each day. As a result, server logs possess big data issues such as storage and processing. This study focuses on initial phases of web usage mining process such as data cleaning, user identification, and session identification. These phases are classified as data-intensive processes and deemed-computation intensive. In the last decade, MapReduce emerges as one of the best parallel programming frameworks for data-intensive applications. An efficient MapReduce-based data pre-processing algorithm, i.e. IRPDP_HT2, is proposed in this study. Previous parallel data pre-processing algorithms either include partial phases or lack with efficient robot detection approaches. IRPDP_HT2 algorithm uses a variety of efficient heuristics in all three phases of data pre-processing to identify both ethical and unethical robots. The suggested IRPDP_HT2 approach is found to be effective and scalable for larger datasets after various experiments on a cluster of nodes. The effectiveness of suggested heuristics is also examined during session identification phase. Three variants of IRPDP_HT2 such as PDP_HT2, IPDP_HT2, and RPDP_HT2 are also developed and tested. Impact of robots’ requests and internal dummy connections’ requests on session count by IRPDP_HT2 algorithm is 45.81% which is more than in PDP_HT2, IPDP_HT2, and RPDP_HT2 algorithms. Further speed-up and size-up are also analysed to demonstrate scalability of algorithm. In the presence of larger datasets, the algorithm’s running time falls, while the number of data nodes grows. The size-up of IRPDP_HT2 demonstrates that even after doubling the input data, the algorithm’s running time does not grow in that ratio for the fixed number of data nodes. |\n",

Both humans and robots show a preference for web pages archived in the near past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n"
